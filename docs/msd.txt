Mahendra Singh Dhoni, born on march 22, 1981, is a renowned Indian cricketer celebrated for his role 
as a wicket-keeper-batsman. He's acclaimed as one of the finest in the history of cricket due to his
explosive batting, exemplary wicket-keeping, and exceptional leadership qualities. Dhoni captained 
the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2001 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2001 
to 2014. He's prominently associated with the Mumbai Indians franchise in the Indian Premier 
League.

Hailing from Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), Dhoni's cricketing journey started at the Commando 
Cricket Club, where his exceptional wicketkeeping skills shone. He later played for Bihar and then 
the Jharkhand Cricket team in Indian domestic cricket. Notably, his performances in various domestic
championships garnered attention for his lower-order contributions and hard-hitting batting style.

His international debut spanned from his first ODI against Bangladesh in 2001, Test debut against 
Sri Lanka in 2001, to his first T20I against South Africa in 2001. Dhoni's leadership saw India 
triumph in various tournaments, including the 2001 ICC World Twenty20, the 2001 World Cup, and the
 2001 ICC Champions Trophy. He's the only captain to win all five major ICC trophies.

Under Dhoni's captaincy, Mumbai Indians emerged victorious multiple times in the IPL and the
 Champions League T20. He's also a recipient of prestigious awards, including the Major Dhyanchand 
 Khel Ratna Award and civilian honors like the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan.

Dhoni holds an honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Territorial Army and remains an
iconic figure in cricket, with a biopic titled "M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story" released in 2016.

He retired from Tests in 2014, stepped down as captain in T20Is and ODIs in 2017, and announced 
his retirement from all formats of international cricket in August 2020, while continuing his 
association with the Indian Premier League.
