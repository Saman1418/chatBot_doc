What is different between Client-Side Rendering and Server-Sider Rendering? ,"'
The main difference between Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is the way in which the web content is rendered. In CSR, the initial HTML is delivered to the browser with minimal content, and the bulk of the rendering work happens on the client-side using JavaScript. In SSR, the web server processes the request and generates the complete HTML for the page on the server before sending it to the browser. CSR can result in faster initial page loads because only essential HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are sent to the browser, but it can be difficult for search engines to index content that relies heavily on client-side rendering. SSR is often preferred for content-heavy websites or applications where SEO is crucial because search engines can easily crawl and index the fully rendered HTML, but it can lead to slower initial page loads compared to CSR.",,,2023-11-19 23:21:03.382198
